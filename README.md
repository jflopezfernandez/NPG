# NPG - Node Project Generator

The goal of this project is to build a robust project generation engine to get C and C++ projects off the ground faster. Ultimately, my goal is for this generator to take dot files containing the project architecture as input, and output a project where the class header and implementation files have not only been generated, but have also been populated with the necessary include statements, include guards, class declarations, class inheritance hierarchies, etc.
